=DdiEditor=
The DdiEditor is the key tool in a *framework of data processing tools and processes* composing data processing of *survey datasets*. The end product is data documentation in accordance with international metadata standard of the collection of surveys. 

The DdiEditor produces metadata documentation in [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ddi-alliance/ DDI-Lifecycle.]

A key objective for development of the DdiEditor is to provide users with a tool which is *configurable, extendable and customisable* allowing users to customise their personal working environment to their needs. 

==Features==
At the moment the DdiEditor is aimed at data *processing for curation purposes* (accommodating the requirements for a data archive).

However, the development project plans to move forward in the direction of providing functionality for the whole data lifecycle. That is *future user groups* will range from *researchers* carrying out a survey to *re-users of data* supplying additional metadata to the original study.

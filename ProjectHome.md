# DdiEditor #
The DdiEditor is the key tool in a **framework of data processing tools and processes** composing data processing of **survey datasets**. The end product is data documentation in accordance with international metadata standard of the collection of surveys.

The DdiEditor produces metadata documentation in [DDI-Lifecycle.](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ddi-alliance/Data%20Documentation%20Initiative/DDI%203.1%20%282009-10-18%29/DDI_3_1_2009-10-18_Documentation_XMLSchema.zip?use_mirror=superb-dca2)

A key objective for development of the DdiEditor is to provide users with a tool which is **configurable, extendable and customisable** allowing users to customise their personal working environment to their needs.

## Features ##
At the moment the DdiEditor is aimed at data **processing for curation purposes** (accommodating the requirements for a data archive).

However, the **development project plans to move forward** in the direction of providing functionality for the whole data lifecycle. That is **future user groups** will range from **researchers** carrying out a survey to **re-users of data** supplying additional metadata to the original study.
